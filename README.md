Computational scientist with a background in applied physics and data analysis, focused on building data-driven models, simulations, and analysis tools for real-world problems.

My work sits at the intersection of scientific computing, statistics, and software engineering. I’ve worked on problems ranging from large-scale data analysis in business contexts to computational modeling and inference in research settings.

### Areas of Focus
- Numerical modeling and simulation
- Data analysis, statistical inference, and uncertainty
- Research-grade code and reproducible workflows
- Translating complex technical results for non-specialist stakeholders

### Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, Astropy, matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn), SQL, Java
- Software: Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, Snowflake, Excel, Salesforce

### Selected Projects
- Gotham Web Lab Research: recovering cosmic filaments in 2D with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Code split into three repos based on where it is designed to run: [NERSC](https://github.com/sarahedraves/nersc-code), [Rubin Science Platform](https://github.com/sarahedraves/LSST_Data), and [offline](https://github.com/sarahedraves/FilamentAnalysis).  
- BDNYC Group Research: collecting and analyzing the light curves of ~200 complex rotator M dwarf stars with K2 and TESS. [Code repo](https://github.com/sarahedraves/SRMP-JMAG-Sarah). 
- Computational Astrophysics Class: final project, homework, and class notes from a class at the CUNY Graduate Center focused on numerical solving and simulation methods. [Code repo](https://github.com/sarahedraves/Draves-GCComputationalAstrophysics).
